## Problem Statement

The proposed web portal aims to provide a platform for the students of Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW) to read and access the technical writings, such as blogs, articles, and papers, written by their peers at the university. The main motivation behind this idea is to promote technical writing among students and to make the writings of the students at the university more accessible and widely read among their peers.

The developers are expected to create a user-friendly portal that is easy to navigate, with a clear and intuitive interface. The portal should be designed in such a way that students can easily search and access the writings of their peers with minimal effort. To make it even more user-friendly, the writings should be well-organized and categorized in appropriate sections, such as by topic or field of study, to make it easy for users to discover new content.

Aesthetically, the web portal should be designed with a dark, holographic or neon theme, which will give it a modern and cutting-edge feel. The design should be interactive, intuitive and make it easy for users to find what they are looking for.

It is important to note that the target audience of the portal are students and staff of IGDTUW, so the design should be tailored to the specific needs and preferences of this user group. Additionally, the portal should be scalable and able to handle a large volume of users and writings, as it will be used by a large number of students and staff at the university. The portal also should be provide features such as commenting, rating and discussion features to foster a sense of community among students who write and read the technical writings.
